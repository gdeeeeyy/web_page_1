<h1>Our first HTML+CSS project?</h1>
<h2>(we really didn't have anyother ideas for the webpage, we're sorry)</h2>
<p1>Ok so, well the members of this group are Krishna, Dheepak and Koushik. And wrote the code for this webpage.</p1>
<br>
<p2>This webpage isn't special or smn, but it does use some html and css concepts so, its win I guess?</p2>
<br>
<p3>So that's that, now look at this cool floating gif(it moves left and right :mindblown:) of Ryan gosling having a mental breakdown(internally)(eventhough he's a humanoid clone that was made to execute orders(a robot for short ig? but not really)</p3>
    <marquee behavior="alternate" direction="right">
        <img src="maxresdefault.jpg" width="400px" alt="ryan gosling?"/>
    </marquee>
<p3>If the picture wasn't displayed it isn't our mistake, the founders of html are plotting stuff against us.</p3>
<br>
<p4>Moving on,...... We'd like to present some hot takes(so I(Krishna) could offend y'all)</p4>
<br>
<p5>(i)Tate is a joke<br>(ii)NGK was a good movie<br>(iii))Vikram had only a good plot but not the best script</p5>
<br>
<p6>Yeah so that's it, we'd like to end this webpage presentation(wk, it was boring)</p6>
<br>
<br>
<p7>Aaaaaaannnddd a small link box so we could flex our HTML and CSS skills</p7>
